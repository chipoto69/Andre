---

## Animation Strategy

### Consistent Pattern Across All Screens
1. **Initial state**: Opacity 0, offset by 20-30px
2. **Trigger**: `.onAppear` with 0.2s base delay
3. **Stagger**: Sequential elements with 0.1s increments
4. **Curves**: `Tokens.Curve.easeOut` for fade-in, `.spring` for scale
5. **Direction**:
   - Headers: Slide up (y-axis)
   - Cards: Slide left (x-axis negative)
   - Suggestions: Slide right (x-axis positive)
   - CTAs: Fade in only

### Screen-Specific Animations
- **Lists**: Left slide for list type cards
- **Focus**: Staggered feature points, glass card preview
- **Switch**: Spring scale for branch icon, right slide for suggestions
- **Wins**: Left slide for win entries, gradient icon scale

---

## Reusable Components Created

### Private Components (Screen-Specific)
1. **ListTypeCard** - List item with icon, color, title, description
2. **FocusItemPreview** - Numbered focus item display
3. **FeaturePointRow** - Icon + text row for features
4. **SuggestionPreviewCard** - Suggestion with circular score
5. **WinEntryPreview** - Win with checkmark and timestamp
6. **BenefitPoint** - Small benefit with checkmark

These components could be made public and moved to shared Components if needed for other features.

## Suggested Improvements for Phase 4 (Ritual Screens)

Based on patterns established in tour screens:

1. **Animation Consistency**
   - Continue staggered animations
   - Use 0.1s delay increments
   - Mix slide and fade for depth

2. **Component Reuse**
   - Consider extracting `FeaturePointRow` to shared components
   - Create reusable "step card" for multi-step rituals
   - Build timeline component for ritual sequences

3. **Visual Elements**
   - Large animated icons for ritual themes
   - Glass cards for immersive previews
   - Progress indicators for multi-step flows
   - Time-of-day illustrations (moon for evening, sun for morning)

4. **Content Structure**
   - Ritual explanation (what/why)
   - Step-by-step breakdown (how)
   - Expected outcome (benefit)
   - Sample interaction preview

5. **Unique Ritual Features**
   - Evening Ritual: Moon icon, focus card creation wizard
   - Morning Ritual: Sun icon, reviewing yesterday's wins
   - Weekly Review: Calendar icon, list maintenance
   - Reflection Prompt: Thought bubble icon, journaling hints
